# Summary:
This repository contains mock physiological data for microplastic exposure experiments with the Eastern Oyster (*Crassostrea virginica*). The data was intended to be similar in content and structure to future data that will be collected from exposure experiments that are projected to take place during the summer of 2021. The mock data contains mortality numbers, growth measurements and cellular energy data for oysters exposed to various concentrations of microplastics (polyester fibers) and pollutants (PCBs). The goal of the data collection is to gain a better understanding of if/how environmentally realistic microplastic exposure impacts *C. virginica* physiology.
