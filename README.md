# Summary:
This repository contains mock physiological data for microplastic exposure experiments with the Eastern Oyster (*Crassostrea virginica*). The data was intended to be similar in content and structure to future data that will be collected from exposure experiments that are projected to take place during the summer of 2021. The mock data contains mortality numbers, growth measurements and cellular energy data for oysters exposed to various concentrations of microplastics (polyester fibers) and pollutants (PCBs). The goal of the data collection is to gain a better understanding of if/how environmentally realistic microplastic exposure impacts *C. virginica* physiology. 


# Structure of Repository:

The repository contains an RMD file called "**Exploratory Markdown.Rmd**". This file is an fully commented exploratory anaylsis of the mock physiological data (BIO539_mock_CEA_data.csv). The file contains tables and figures as well as my thought process throughout the analysis. Some tables and figures generated were for use within the final report, others were strictly for exploratory purposes. 

The **BIO539_final_report.pdf** file is the research paper that resulted from the exploratory analysis of the mock data. It should be noted that since the data analyzed was not real, the methods section of the report is referring to methods we *plan* to use during the actual experiment. All methods and statistical analyses are tentative and subject to change. 

The repository also contains three folders called: Figures, Metadata, and Raw Data. 

**Figures:** contains all of the graphs and tables generated during the exploratory analysis that were saved as a .jpg and used within the final report.

**Metadata:** contains a .csv file with the metadata for the mock physiological data (BIO539_mock_CEA_data.csv). Specifically, the csv contains explanations and units for the parameters mentioned within the physiological data.

**Raw data:** contains all of the mock physiological data used for the exploratory analysis. Physiological data consisted of: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, energy available, energy consumed, cellular energy allocated, in addition to mortality totals and shell length measurements.
